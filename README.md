# Scheme-o-matic
This tool is a web-based, locally-hosted editor and debugger for the variant of the programming language Scheme taught in CS 61A.

To run with a homework for lab, download the entire folder and run the command `python3 editor`.

To run without okpy, run the command `python3 editor -f`. (note that there may be some initial layout glitches before a file is opened).

This tool has no dependencies, and requires web access only to load the Glyphicons (all other libraries are self contained).
