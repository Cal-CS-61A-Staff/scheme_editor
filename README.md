# Scheme-o-matic
This tool is a web-based, locally-hosted editor and debugger for the variant of the programming language Scheme taught in CS 61A.

To run, download the entire folder and run the command `python3.7 editor`. Note that Python 3.7 is required for the current version of the tool in this repo - if you want to run it on Python 3.6, strip the type annotations from all the *.py files and remove the line `from __future__ import annotations` from all the files, and it should immediately work.

This tool has no dependencies, and requires web access only to load the Glyphicons (all other libraries are self contained).
